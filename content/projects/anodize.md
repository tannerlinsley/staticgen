description: Generate modern pages from minimal source files.

Anodize exists because I was too lazy to learn how to use Jekyll. Its continuing mission: to boldly generate functional, SE-optimized websites from as little source data as possible.

Anodize currently powers Sid Mani's blog at https://www.sidmani.com.

You can get anodize as a command-line tool on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/anodize):  
`$ npm install -g anodize`  
`$ anodize init`
