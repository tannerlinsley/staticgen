# staticgen.com

[staticgen.com](http://staticgen.com), a leaderboard of top open-source static site generators.

## Contributing

Missing a static site generator here? Just fork the repo and add your generator
as a `<name>.md` in the `source/projects` folder.

Make sure to follow the following rules:

*   **Static Site Generation:** No "flat-file CMSs" or similar tools. The program must be able to output a static website that can be hosted in places like Netlify, S3 or Github Pages.
*   **Open Source:** The generator must have a public repository on Github that we can link to and pull in stats from.
*   **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other static site generators in `content/projects`.
*   **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.

## Usage

Be sure that you have the latest node and npm installed, then clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

In order to successfully retrieve Twitter followers and GitHub stars, you will need authentication
keys for both services.

For GitHub, all you'll need is a personal access token. This can be generated at
<https://github.com/settings/tokens>. For Twitter, you need to create an application at
<https://apps.twitter.com> to get the necessary tokens. When deploying, you must set the environment
variables per the example below. If you are developing locally, you can set
these in a `.env` file at the root of the repo.

```
STATICGEN_GITHUB_TOKEN=examplekey123abc
STATICGEN_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=examplekey231abc
STATICGEN_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=examplekey321abc
STATICGEN_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=examplekey231abc
STATICGEN_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=examplekey321abc
```

GitHub and Twitter data is cached in the `.tmp` directory, and online in a Gist. If neither has data
newer than 24 hours old, fresh data is fetched from GitHub and Twitter. Fetching caching occur
automatically during the build.

Then visit http://localhost:3000/ - React Static will automatically reload when changes occur.

To test a production build locally, do:

```bash
npm run stage
npm run serve
```

To run a production build for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Configuration

This repo uses a `site.yaml` file to provide high level configurability, with the eventual goal of
deriving a generic boilerplate that can be used for generating an open source leaderboard without
editing the site source.

The currently supported keys for `site.yaml` are present in the file itself, documentation of
available options will be provided when the generic boilerplate is published.
